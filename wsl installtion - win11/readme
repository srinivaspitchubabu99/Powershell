# WSL Installation Script

This PowerShell script automates the installation of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows 10 and Windows 11. It enables the WSL feature, sets WSL to version 2, and allows users to select their desired Linux distribution for installation.

## Features

- Enable WSL feature
- Set WSL version to 2
- List available Linux distributions
- User input for selecting a distribution

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 version 1903 or later, or Windows 11
- Administrator privileges to run the script

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**
   - Clone this repository or download the script file `InstallWSL.ps1`.

2. **Set the PowerShell Execution Policy**
   - Open PowerShell as an administrator:
     - Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu.
     - Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select "Run as administrator".
   - Set the execution policy to allow script execution:
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
     ```
     If prompted, type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.

3. **Run the Script**
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the script:
     ```powershell
     cd C:\Path\To\Your\Script
     ```
   - Execute the script:
     ```powershell
     .\InstallWSL.ps1
     ```

4. **Select a Distribution**
   - The script will list available Linux distributions. Enter the name of the distribution you want to install (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian).

## Example Output

```plaintext
Enabling Windows Subsystem for Linux...
Setting WSL version to 2...
Available Linux distributions:
   Ubuntu
   Debian
   Kali-Linux
   Fedora
   ...

## Important Notes

- **Execution Policies:**
  - `Restricted`: No scripts can be run. This is the default setting.
  - `AllSigned`: Only scripts signed by a trusted publisher can be run.
  - `RemoteSigned`: Scripts created locally can be run, and downloaded scripts must be signed.
  - `Unrestricted`: All scripts can be run.

- **Revert Execution Policy (Optional):**
  After running your script, you may want to set the execution policy back to its original state:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
  ```
